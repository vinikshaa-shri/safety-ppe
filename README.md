hi, in the safety ppe project i have used yolov8 pre-trained model and attached the train code to train ur own dataset by just changing the custom dataset file.
I have also added trained model which can be used directly for prediction
Pre-trained Model: Includes a pre-trained YOLOv8 model for immediate use in PPE detection tasks.
Custom Dataset Training: Provides the ability to train the model on custom datasets, allowing adaptation to specific environments and requirements.
Easy Inference: Simple API for performing inference on images and videos, enabling quick detection of PPE items.
